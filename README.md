### Questions to Answer
* What trends exist in residential real estate prices in the Mecklenburg area?
* What can we expect future home prices to be based on historical data?


### Visuals
* Line graph with median home price by month 
* Gauge for lower to upper ranges of home prices
* Drop down to select a year and see median home prices for each week for that year
* Number of homes sold by month 
* Trend line for age of inventory 
* Median Days to Close by timeframe
* Percent of total active listings with price drops
* Percent of homes sold above list
* Demonstrate total active listings against other factors?

### Technology Utilized:
* Scikit_Learn
* Python Pandas
* Python Matplotlib
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* GitHubPages 

### Conclusions:
* Charlotte real estate as a whole is growing rapidly
* Less established areas are gaining popularity 
* Slower growth in expensive areas 
* Summer months are the most popular for purchasing a home
* Home sales were down by about 50% during 2020 due to lack of inventory
